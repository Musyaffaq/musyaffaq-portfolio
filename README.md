# Musyaffaq's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website. This is my first MERN full stack web application which I am using as a way to learn to create a MERN web app from start to deployment.

Although it may look like a static website, the data on the projects and work experiences pages is actually being fetched through an API endpoint, which I created using Express.js and Node.js, from a MongoDB database. You can check out the API endpoint [here](https://musyaffaq-portfolio-api.vercel.app).

Additionally, I have made it so that I can edit those data through the frontend. In order to do so, I have made it so that I can be authenticated (i.e. log in) and then add new projects or experiences through a form. That API endpoint is also protected through that authentication.

For sure there are more things that can be done to make this website better, but this is good enough for now! Feel free to contact me if you see anything wrong with it.

Here is a diagram to help visualise how the web app works:
