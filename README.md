# Musyaffaq's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website. This is my first MERN full stack web application which I am using as a way to learn to create a MERN web app from start to deployment.

Although it may look like a static website, the information on the projects and work experiences pages is actually being fetched through an API endpoint, which I created using Express.js and Node.js, from a MongoDB database. You can check out the API endpoint [here](https://musyaffaq-portfolio-api.vercel.app).

One feature I would like to work on next is to add authentication (i.e. log in and log out) so that I would be able to edit the projects and work experiences pages through the frontend.

Here is a diagram to help visualise how the web app works:
